/**
 * Sidecar store for per-machine ranking signals.
 *
 * Keeps `importance`, `recency`, `maturity`, `accessCount`, `updateCount`
 * out of context-tree markdown frontmatter so that query-time bumps don't
 * dirty version-controlled files or create merge conflicts across teammates.
 *
 * Backed by `IKeyStorage` with composite keys of the form
 * `["signals", ...pathSegments]`. The relative path is split on `/` so each
 * segment satisfies the key-storage validation rules.
 *
 * All paths are relative to the context tree root (e.g. `auth/jwt-refresh.md`)
 * using forward slashes, matching how paths flow through the rest of the
 * knowledge pipeline.
 *
 * ## Concurrency guarantees
 *
 * Atomicity applies **within a single process**. Two `update` calls on the
 * same path in the same process serialize via the per-key RWLock inside
 * `FileKeyStorage` — no lost updates.
 *
 * Across processes (daemon + CLI), the per-process locks do not coordinate,
 * so there is a narrow lost-update window when both processes race a read-
 * modify-write on the same entry. For ranking signals this is acceptable:
 * losing one access-hit bump has no correctness impact, only a tiny
 * ranking drift that the next session self-heals. Do **not** rely on
 * this interface for data where consistency is required (e.g. identifiers,
 * counters that must never skip).
 *
 * ## Invariants NOT enforced here
 *
 * The store accepts any `RuntimeSignals` record that satisfies the schema —
 * it does not enforce semantic invariants such as the importance ↔ maturity
 * hysteresis defined by `determineTier`. Callers bumping `importance` must
 * recompute `maturity` themselves (typically via `determineTier`) as part
 * of the same updater callback.
