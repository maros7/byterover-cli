/**
 * Onboarding store
 *
 * Tracks first-time-user flags (persisted in localStorage) and the live tour
 * state (in-memory only; closing the browser exits the tour). The tour is a
 * lightweight state machine that orchestrates which dialog/sheet is open and
 * what content is prefilled. Steps:
 *
 *   1. provider  — open ProviderFlowDialog, advance when an active provider
 *                  config exists
 *   2. curate    — open TaskComposerSheet prefilled with a curate example.
 *                  After submit, the composer closes and tourTaskId tracks
 *                  the in-flight task; the tour stays on `curate` until the
 *                  user clicks the Continue CTA in the task detail.
 *   3. query     — same flow with a query example
 *   4. connector — show "connect to your AI tool" panel, end tour on Done
